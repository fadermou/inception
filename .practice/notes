docker system prune -a: removes all data (containers volumes ...)
docker image ls -q : shows all the id
docker image remove -f $(docker image ls -q) : removes them all by id
docker-compose down --rmi local --remove-orphans : removes all what docker compose builded 
dockerocker-compose up --build  
docker system prune --volumes:   - all stopped containers- all networks not used by at least one container- all anonymous volumes not used by at least one container- all dangling images- all dangling build cache
